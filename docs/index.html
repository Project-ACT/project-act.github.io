			<p>Some basic starter info for Project-ACT</p>

			<h2>Autonomous Cohort Transformation</h2>
			<p>This side of our Project is moving more slowly since the national Brigade program was sunset in December 2023. However, there are still opportunities to work with former brigades as well as newly-forming cohorts of civic volunteers who would like to, for example, form a stand-alone (autonomous) organization and pursue a 501(c)(3) determination with the IRS.</p>
			<p>Elements of this side of the Project will evolve over time, but again more slowly with the change in circumstances experienced simultaneously by all former brigades, as they plot a course into the future based on the wants and needs of their particular cohort.</p>

			<h2>Autonomous Cohort Tessellation</h2>
			<p>A tessellation is a mosaic, and in this context an illustration of the various cohorts and projects active around the US and perhaps beyond. Of course to generate that tessellation there needs to be data and then information, and this is the focus of this element of the project. Discovery, visibility, communication, collaborationâ€¦ these begin with knowing that there are others with similar ideals, similar intent, sometimes similar goals and even similar projects.</p>
